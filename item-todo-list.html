            <p>This is where it all began. My journey to becoming a front-end engineer started (kind of) with this simple to-do app. See, I had an issue at 
                work that I wanted to solve. I could code up what I wanted to do in python, but it needed a front-end. Specifically a front-end that could display
            two tables that could transfer data back and forth between them. That's really it, I went down the front-end dev rabbit hole because flask couldn't transfer 
            a row of data between two tables! I found scrimba's free Learn React tutorial and the rest is history.</p>
            <p>The app looked pretty plain and boring when I first started, and I only added a small bit of functionality, since at the same time I was going through the 
                tutorial to build this I was also coding my own React app to solve my work problem. Also I really didn't know or want to know css yet. This is what the app 
                looked like when I first deployed it to github pages: 
            </p>
            <img src='/img/todo-old.png' alt='sad looking previous version of to-do list app'>
            <p>It is quite amazing how styling can make a difference. The functionality of the app is essentially the same (I fixed some bugs and added local storage usage instead 
                of starting with fake default tasks). Now I know javascript a lot better, and I actually know what flexbox and grid are now and how to use them. I also took the 
                time to learn how to customize checkboxes. I had no idea it was so complicated, but now I know how to make them look nice and keep them accessible thanks to 
                <a href='https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/inclusively-hiding-and-styling-checkboxes-and-radio-buttons/'>this article</a>. 
                At the time of posting this I'm about to dive back into learning React after finishing the scrimba front end career path javascript/css/html components. 
                Hopefully I will have another cool react app to share soon that really shows off my skills, but for now take this as a story of my journey so far, 
                and how far I've come in just a short amount of time, all because I couldn't make two tables.
